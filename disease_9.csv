Cultural Practices: Remove and destroy infected trees to prevent the spread of the disease. Ensure good orchard sanitation by eliminating potential sources of infection.
Insect Control: Implement intensive chemical control measures to manage the Asian citrus psyllid populations, which are responsible for spreading HLB.
Research and Development: Ongoing research is focused on developing resistant citrus varieties and exploring treatments that can alleviate symptoms, such as the use of antioxidants and growth hormones.
Monitoring and Reporting: Regularly inspect citrus trees for symptoms of HLB and report any findings to agricultural authorities to help control outbreaks.",,,
